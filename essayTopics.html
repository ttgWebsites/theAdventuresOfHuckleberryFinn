					<li data-theme="b">How is the river a symbol in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">One could see the river as a symbol of the freedom Huck and Jim desire.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The two are both searching for a way to get away from civilization, Huck because he doesn't like the lifestyle, and Jim because he is a runaway slave.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The river provides a place of refuge where they can be free, much like the flow of a river, free to float on carelessly.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However their freedom is short lived as they cannot continually float on problem free.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Eventually the river brings them face to face with society and its stresses as they miss the mouth of the Ohio River and are instead left to float on towards the Deep South, a place very dangerous for Jim, as well as bringing dangers to Huck as well.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though it seems to offer freedom, eventually they float into troubled waters and must face the challenges presented to them, just like the path of life, as no matter how care free one tries to be, eventually life's problems become present and must be dealt with.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">How is Huck an effective character despite being a young boy?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though Huck is a young boy, his character is much more effective than any other person would be in the novel as the powerlessness and vulnerability of being a child relates closest to that of being black.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This is significant because of Jim's character.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The two are able to relate to each other because they are both put down and controlled by adult white men.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They both seek freedom, though for different reasons, the thought is essentially the same.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Huck is abused by his father as well as feels as if other adults are trying to control him, meanwhile Jim is abused and controlled by a slave owner.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Their similar issues makes it easy for them to relate to one another, and helps allow a friendship.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Another reason why Huck being a child is more effective is because he is still open for self improvement and still learning between right and wrong.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">As a thirteen year old he is developing his morals, and at that age in particular, the adventure means probably the most to who he will become in the future.</li>
